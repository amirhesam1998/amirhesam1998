# üí´ About Me:
## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

I‚Äôm a junior Back-End Developer with a degree in Applied Mathematics, which has helped me build a solid foundation in logical thinking, problem-solving, and system analysis. My passion for technology and software engineering led me into backend development, where I focus on designing and building reliable, scalable, and maintainable systems.

My journey started with Python and PHP, and over time I‚Äôve expanded my expertise to include C# and the .NET ecosystem. I‚Äôm especially enthusiastic about learning and applying modern architectural patterns that make software systems flexible, domain-aligned, and easy to evolve.
üîß Tech Stack & Expertise

    Languages: C#, Python, PHP

    Frameworks: .NET 6/7/8, Django, Laravel

    Databases: SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL), NoSQL (MongoDB)

    Tools: Docker, Linux, Git, Postman

    API Design: RESTful APIs, API Gateway, Swagger/OpenAPI

    DevOps: Containerization with Docker, Linux server management

    Design Patterns: SOLID, Factory, Repository, Mediator, etc.

    Testing: Unit testing, Integration testing

üß† Architecture & Domain Thinking

I am especially interested in building systems using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles to bridge the gap between business needs and technical implementation. I believe in organizing code and systems around the core domain, using:

    Bounded Contexts to isolate different parts of the system

    Ubiquitous Language to ensure clarity across teams

    Aggregates, Entities, and Value Objects to model domain logic accurately

    Application & Domain layers using Clean Architecture principles

    Emphasis on Separation of Concerns, Loose Coupling, and High Cohesion

I'm currently exploring Microservices Architecture, and how services can be independently deployed, scaled, and maintained. I‚Äôve worked on small-scale microservices involving:

    Service communication through REST or Message Queues

    Event-driven design with eventual consistency

    API Gateway with YARP in .NET

    Service registry/discovery, authentication, and distributed logging

ü§ù Work Ethic & Collaboration

I enjoy working in collaborative environments using Agile and Scrum methodologies. I value:

    Writing clean, maintainable, and well-documented code

    Continuous learning and improving as a developer

    Pair programming and code reviews

    Participating in discussions on architecture, business logic, and tech strategy

üöÄ Goals

I'm currently looking for opportunities where I can:

    Apply my knowledge of .NET, C#, and architectural patterns

    Grow within a professional team that values clean code and thoughtful design

    Build domain-oriented, scalable, and resilient systems that solve real business problems
